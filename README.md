# graph-embedding

This repo includes graph embedding related models developed by our team, including:

1. [UGE-Unbiased-Graph-Embedding](https://github.com/HCDM/graph-embedding/tree/main/UGE-Unbiased-Graph-Embedding) [1] which generates unbiased node embedding when the graph topology is biased by sensitive node attributes.
2. SPAC-SPectral-AttaCk [2] which generates adversarial structural perturbation using spectral distance.
3. GraphHAM-Graph-Hierarchical-Attentive-Membership [3] which jointly learns node embedding and hierarchical membership of nodes toward hidden groups.
4. CGAT-Channel-aware-Graph-Attention-Network [4] which captures the textual content on edges to enable a channel-aware attention mechanism on GNNs.
